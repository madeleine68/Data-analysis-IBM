# IBM Data Analysis Course
 
This repository is one part of my learning process to master data analysis skills with python.
The workflow begins with data wrangling, moves to exploratory analysis using Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Scipy, then proceeds to model development, and finishes with model evaluation.
The data set for this project includes information about cars.
